I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My main research interests are the political economy of development; the economics of corruption; judicial politics; natural language processing (NLP); philosophy, politics, and economics (PPE); and the morality of markets.

In addition to academic research, I have more than eight years of progressive experience in economic analysis and policy implementation. I have held positions in government and research institutions, such as the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Brookings Institution, and the Center of Politics and Public Economics (CEPESP-FGV).

I will be joining the Growth Lab at Harvard's Center for International Development as a Post-Doctoral Fellow in June 2020.
