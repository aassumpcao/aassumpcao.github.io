I am a post-doctoral research fellow at UNC's Criminal Justice Innovation Lab, where I focus on U.S. criminal justice issues (bail reform, policing, over criminalization, etc.). I am also a affiliated researcher at the Brazilian Asssociation of Jurimetrics (ABJ), where I work on policy projects to improve the Brazilian justice system. I am broadly interested in empirical legal studies and natural language processing (NLP) applications in the legal world.

In addition to academic research, I have more than ten years of progressive experience in policy research. I have held positions in government and research institutions, such as the Center for International Development at the Harvard Kennedy School, the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Brookings Institution, and the Center of Politics and Public Economics (CEPESP-FGV).
