I am a data scientist at the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), where I am contributing new data science tools (data dashboards, database management, predictive and causal inference) to the Research and Court Consulting divisions' core products. I am broadly interested in both applied and academic research involving empirical legal studies and natural language processing (NLP).

Prior to the NCSC, I have held research positions in government and think tanks, such as UNCâ€™s Criminal Justice Innovation Lab, the Center for International Development at the Harvard Kennedy School, the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Brookings Institution, and the Center of Politics and Public Economics (CEPESP-FGV).
