I am a post-doctoral research fellow at the Growth Lab program in the Center for International Development at the Harvard Kennedy School. My main research interests are the political economy of development; empirical legal studies; the economics of corruption; natural language processing (NLP); philosophy, politics, and economics (PPE); and the morality of markets.

In addition to academic research, I have more than eight years of progressive experience in economic analysis and policy implementation. I have held positions in government and research institutions, such as the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth, & Development Office, the Brookings Institution, and the Center of Politics and Public Economics (CEPESP-FGV).
